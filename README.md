### Gitcoin Bounty Proposal Twitter Bot

To better capture potential bounties for Open Source projcts it would be great if Twitter users could publically message a bot and recommend a bounty to propose to the community.

#### User Story
As a Developer I want to easily propose new bounty ideas and have other developers agree/disagree with the idea.

#### How It Could Work

- Twitter Bot Connects to Public Github Repo
- People can @BountyBot to easily create a new Issue on repo.
- Users can Like to the tweet to signal support for the potential bounty.
If the idea gains enough "Yes" votes the bot will then ask everyone to donate to the bounty.
